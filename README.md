# tree-based-models-classifier
“Implementation and visualization of Decision Trees and Random Forests for classification and regression tasks using Scikit-learn. Includes overfitting control, feature importance analysis, and cross-validation evaluation.”
# Tree-Based Models Classifier

## 📌 Overview
This project explores tree-based machine learning models including:
- Decision Tree Classifier & Regressor
- Random Forest Classifier & Regressor  

It covers:
✅ Visualization of decision trees  
✅ Controlling model complexity (depth, pruning)  
✅ Feature importance interpretation  
✅ Model evaluation using cross-validation  

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Graphviz (for tree visualization)

## 🚀 How to Run
1️⃣ Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tree-based-models-classifier.git
cd tree-based-models-classifier
## 🛠 Install Dependencies
